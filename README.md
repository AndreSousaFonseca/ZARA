Overview
This system enhances a medical Q&A dataset by extracting entities using Scispacy, converts the data into LangChain-compatible documents, builds a FAISS vector store with medical embeddings, and utilizes a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to answer medical queries. It leverages the Groq LLM for response generation, incorporating retrieved relevant documents for more accurate answers.

Approach
Data Preprocessing: The medical Q&A data is enhanced by extracting medical entities (e.g., diseases, symptoms) using SciSpacy's.
Document Conversion: The enhanced data is converted into LangChain Document objects, including metadata like disease type and UMLS codes.
Vector Database Creation: The documents are embedded using a medical-specific BERT model, stored in a FAISS vector store for efficient retrieval.
RAG Model: A Groq LLM (e.g., llama3-70b-8192) is used for context-based medical query answering, leveraging retrieved documents to generate accurate responses.

Performance
The system can answer a wide range of medical queries based on the context retrieved from the document stored, making it effective for quick information retrieval.
Performance may degrade with large datasets if not optimized for scalability (computationally expensive)

Improvements
Model Architecture Refinements: Consider experimenting with different embedding models (e.g., PubMedBert)
Experiment with Larger Models: Test with larger LLMs such as Llama-2 or GPT-4 for potentially better accuracy in understanding and generating medical responses.
Scalability: Implementing a distributed FAISS index and optimizing document chunking can improve performance with larger datasets.
